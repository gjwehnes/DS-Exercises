### TwoDArrayPractice2

Complete the sumRow method.
- The method should take in an 2D integer array and a row number.  The method should return the sum of the elements in a given row.
- For example, if row = 0, you should return the sum of all the elements in the topmost row.
- You will need to be careful with 'jagged' arrays, where not every row has the same length!
