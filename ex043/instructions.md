### TwoDArrayPractice3
Complete the max2Delement method.
- The method should take in a 2D array as a parameter and return the highest value in the array.
- You will need to account for negative numbers as well. This may seem trivial but actually will require
some thought. How do you detect if a number is lower than any already checked? Hint - what is the lowest
possible value that a Java double can be?
