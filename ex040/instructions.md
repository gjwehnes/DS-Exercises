### Arraylists4

Create a static method that:
- is called mergeLists and returns an ArrayList
- takes two parameters: an ArrayList of Strings called wordList1, and an ArrayList of Strings called wordList2
- returns a new ArrayList of type String, which contains the words from wordList1 interspersed with the words  from wordList2.

See the unit test for examples.

#### Note
- you will need to be careful with lists of unequal length!
