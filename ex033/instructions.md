### ArrayLoopingPractice1

Complete the combineNames method to return a new String array that is composed of the first name and last name of each of the parameters.

This may be confusing so look at the example:
first_names = {"bob","joe"}
last_names = {"jones","smith"}

returns a new String array with {"bob jones", "joe smith"}
