### Arraylists1


Create a static method that:
- is called combineLists and returns an ArrayList
- takes two parameters: an ArrayList of Strings called wordList1, and an ArrayList of Strings called wordList2
- returns a new ArrayList of type String, which contains the words (in order) from wordList1, and then all the words (in order) from wordList2. See the unit test for examples.
