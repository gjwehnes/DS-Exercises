### ArrayLoopingPractice4

- Complete the maxLength method so that given the array words, it will return the word with the largest length.

- If the array is empty or if the array is null, return an empty string.

- If there are two words with equal length, return the one with the lower index (i.e. the one that occurs earlier in the list)
