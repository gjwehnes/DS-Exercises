### ArrayLoopingPractice3

Complete the maxValue method so that given an array of integers, it will return the maximum value in the array. 

Again, an exceptional ('edge') case occurs when the array is empty. What would the maximum be? Mathematically, we would
consider the answer to be undefined (which is not the same as zero!). Thus, your method should return NaN, which
is a way of indicating that the value could not be calculated.
