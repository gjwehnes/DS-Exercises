### ArrayLoopingPractice3

- Complete the maxValue method so that given an array of integers, it will return the maximum value in the array. 
- Again, an exceptional ('edge') case occurs when the array is empty. What would the maximum be? Mathematically, we would consider the answer to be undefined (which is not the same as zero!). In this case, return the minimum value of an integer. Whether that is semantically correct is debatable, but certainly this can be done, and it is worthwhile to know how. See the unit test for how the minimum value is defined.
