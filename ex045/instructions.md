Complete the sumColumn method so that given a 2-D int array and an integer representing the column to sum, 
sum up the all elements in that column in the given array.
- if the index does not exist (i.e. it is greater than the shortest row or if the array is null, then your method must throw an ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.
