### ArrayPractice2

Complete the sumElements method to find the average of all elements in the given array.

An exceptional ('edge') case occurs when the array is empty. What would the average be? Mathematically, we would
consider the answer to be undefined (which is not the same as zero!). Thus, your method should return NaN, which
is a way of indicating that the value could not be calculated.
See https://www.baeldung.com/java-not-a-number for background on what an NaN is.
